If you have an NFC-enabled Android phone or tablet, you can use this
app to display the contents of your Black Hat USA 2012 RFID badge.  To
use, simply start the app and touch your badge to the back of your
device.

You can either build the project yourself, or use the debug binary
provided in the bin folder.
